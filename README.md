# GetLiveXamlInfo

This is experimental.
It does things that are unsupported, it uses things that are undocumented, and accesses private assemblies and internal code that it shouldn't.

No promises or guarantees about anything to do with this code or it's use.

It works on my machine and that's all I need. Sorry.
